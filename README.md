# JavaScripts Games
In these beginner level games, you'll find madlibs (as per entire file name), random number guessing, if else game guessing a number, questions to answer to achieve a gold silver or bronze crown, & random math output for two variables. Thanks for checking it out!
These games are some examples of my first attempts at using JavaScript.
