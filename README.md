# JavaScripts Games
In these beginner level games, you'll find madlibs (as per entire file name),
a random number guessing, 
a if/else game guessing a number,
a game where you're asked questions to achieve a gold silver or bronze crown, & random math output for two variables. 

These games won't display the answers until the end of answering every game (which will all appear as a alert box). At the end, you'll see the entirety of your answers. 
Thanks for checking it out!
These games are some examples of my first attempts at using JavaScript using the TeamTreeHouse courses, here's a link to my profile there: https://teamtreehouse.com/alexanderayala
